# Goth Life
An broody mod for Ellpeck's game Tiny Life.

# Installing mods
Installing a mod is pretty simple:
- Find the `Tiny Life` folder (you can open it from the game's options menu)
- Find the `Mods` folder in there
- If you received the mod you want to install as a `zip` (or any other kind of) archive, extract it first
- Put the mod's `dll` as well as its `Content` folder into the `Mods` folder.

Done! Now just start the game and the mod should automatically load. If there are any errors, they'll be logged in the `Log.txt` file in the `Tiny Life` folder.
